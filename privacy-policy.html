								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<p>1.1 About the Privacy Policy. This BizNameWiz.com Privacy and Cookie Policy (the
									“Privacy Policy”) governs the processing of personal data collected from individual

									controller with regard to the personal data collected through BNW.</p>
								<p>1.3 Your consent. Before you submit any personal data through BNW, you are encouraged
									to read this Privacy Policy that is always available on https://BizNameWiz.com to

									personal data. In some cases, if required by the applicable law, we may seek to
